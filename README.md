# 18-327-wavelets-filter-banks
This repository is an implementation, using Python with numpy, scipy, matlibplot, PyWavelets and GNU Octave, of MIT OCW 18.327 spring 2003 Wavelets, Filter Banks, and Applications. 

MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) OCW (Open-CourseWare) 18.327 Wavelets, Filter Banks, and Applications Spring 2003 was taught by Gilbert Strang and Kevin Amaratunga; software they used was all for Matlab.  In this repository, you can do everything (and more!) involving Filter Banks and Wavelets in Python, with numpy, scipy, matlibplot, PyWavelets, and GNU Octave!  The hope is that this repository will be useful at the pedagogical level allowing anyone, anywhere, anytime, with open-source software (OSS), to learn about Wavelets and Filter Banks, and encourage OSS usage in research and industry.
